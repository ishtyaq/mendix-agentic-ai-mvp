# Mendix Agentic AI – Practical MVP Sample

This repository contains a simple Mendix sample project demonstrating
how to adopt agentic AI in an MVP using Mendix GenAI and Agents.

## What’s included
- Predictive agent for ticket prioritization and next-action suggestions
- Chat agent for querying ticket data using natural language
- Structured prompts with JSON outputs
- Microflow-based function tools
- Support Starter App as the base

## Mendix Version
Tested with Mendix Studio Pro 10.24.10

## Prerequisites

5. Run locally and test agents from Agent Overview

## Notes/ Limitations
- This project is intended for learning and MVP experimentation
- Not production-hardened
- Prompts and agents can be exported/imported as JSON
- Demo-oriented prompts; not production hardened; keys must be stored safely

## Demo
A short silent demo video is included in the LinkedIn article.
